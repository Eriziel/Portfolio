## About me
My name is Marcin Bucholc. I am psychologist, diagnostician and since 2019 a software tester. My main goal is to spread my wings as a professional tester. To achieve it I am extending my testing knowledge and enchancing technical skills. Here is the space where I want to show my progress.

## Testing weapon of choice

2. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira0), [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki) - open source issue tracker and project management software
3. [TestLink](http://testlink.org/) - open source test management tool
4. [Mantis](https://www.mantisbt.org/), [Bugzilla](https://www.bugzilla.org/) - bug reporting tool
